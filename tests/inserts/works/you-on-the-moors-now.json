  "description": "**_You On The Moors Now_** is a grand theatrical examination of four well-known literary heroines of the 19th-century and their shocking rejection of the men who so ardently loved them. What results is a confluence of love, anger, grief, haunting, bloody battles and single tears shed by an ensemble of actors struggling to reconcile the romantic confines of the past with their own contemporary ideas of courtship. **_You On The Moors Now_** takes everything you've ever learned about love, gleaned from the pages of _Pride and Prejudice_, _Jane Eyre_, _Wuthering Heights_, and _Little Women_, and puts it somewhere in the tall grasses, hidden from view, where only the truly brave will ever traverse to earn it."
