And music really sucks because there's no polyphony. And society has forced her to marry. And she's being followed by this really annoying guy who keeps writing poems about her. Loosely based on the figure at the center of Dante's Vita Nuova and Divine Comedy, BEATRICE is a story of Heaven and Hell, life and death, love and loss, a woman ahead of her time, and the number three."
