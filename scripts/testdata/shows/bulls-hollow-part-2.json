A little context: You are at a developmental workshop of Part Two of an epic, three-part story — that's right, a trilogy! And, don't worry, we have not shared Part One yet, so you haven't missed anything. Our plan is that the three parts can, eventually, be seen in any order. Thank you for coming out to support big, brand new, crazy ideas. We wish you and yours endless Beast-given blessings.",
