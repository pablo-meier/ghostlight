On their last night together at the annual dating convention for Singles in Agriculture, Priscilla angles for sex, while Joel pursues his own, mysterious intent.\n\n Inspired by research on the real-life organization, Singles in Agriculture (O’Neill Finalist, 2015) offers glimpses into a rural landscape where social isolation and economic exploitation intensify the hopes, anxieties, and losses that we all sign up for when we search for love.
