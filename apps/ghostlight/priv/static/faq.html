<h1>Answers to Questions Someone May Ask</h1>
<p>I'm writing these in the first person as Pablo because that's who I am.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr Go to the Discourse site if you wanna hash shit out, let me teach you to
write code, and so far this is just me doing building a thing with no Greater
Ambitions, but I have no idea what the future holds.</strong></p>
<h3>What is the purpose of ghostlight?</h3>
<p>There's not a short answer to that — you can read the <a href="/about">About page</a> for the
sales-pitchey angle at it. <em>But</em> if I abandon the sales pitchey angle, here's
the short version: <strong>I'm applying Computers to Theatre as best I can, and seeing
what happens next.</strong> ghostlight was originally conceived as an archiving tool,
then was thought to be a social network, and now it's more like a project
directory. The more I work on it the more things I realize I can do with it.</p>
<p>Like many Made Things That Are Cool, there are a lot of feelings behind this.</p>
<p>Every time I opened the program of any show I was watching, I saw one part of a
very rich story that wasn't getting much further than the paper it was printed
on. Virtually every artist I knew in the performing arts was building a career
(and a life!) that was mostly going to exist in their head, or that of their
friends'. I also feel like there's a lot of confusion over ideas of web presence
— <em>what</em> should your website be achieving? <em>Who</em> should that site (and your
work) be reaching?  <em>How</em> will you answer those questions, and once you have
those answers, how will you achieve it?</p>
<p>Given that almost all program bios are listings of a person's previous work,
what happens if we can connect it?</p>
<h3>What projects inspired ghostlight?</h3>
<p>A running trope in tech is to describe a product in relation to another: it's
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/28/cherry-san-diego/">&quot;Uber for Car Washes&quot;</a>! A &quot;ChatRoulette for Dogs&quot;! It's not too hard to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMmdl4VltD4">sound like a complete jackass</a>.</p>
<p>That said, comparing ghostlight to other sites can be instructive in both
explaining what it does, where it came from, and what informs some of its
design.</p>
<h5><strong>pw greenbook</strong></h5>
<p>In college, I was a member of <a href="http://pw.brown.edu/">production workshop</a>, which, if you know me
IRL, I can talk your ear off about. We had a <a href="http://pw.brown.edu/wiki/start">wiki</a>. We used that wiki to
make pages for all kinds of things, like <a href="http://pw.brown.edu/wiki/people/daniel_rogers_08">people</a>, <a href="http://pw.brown.edu/wiki/shows/the_verge">shows</a>, etc. Sometimes
we linked them together!</p>
<p>One place was <a href="http://pw.brown.edu/wiki/people/greenbook">the green book</a>, which was the first name for ghostlight
(dropped because its not as good a name, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/26/facebook-placebook-teachbook/">Facebook would surely sue if it
ever got traction</a>).</p>
<p>I groomed that wiki pretty thoroughly while I was there, and always wished that
had taken off. Now's my chance!</p>
<h5><strong>GitHub</strong></h5>
<p><a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> was the first major inspiration — for most working
programmers, this is a household name, whereas for non-programmers it's never
been heard of. GitHub offers tools to make it easier for individual programmers
to store and share their work, and for groups of programmers to work together on
something, and/or remix the work of someone else.</p>
<p>You can, for example, see <a href="https://github.com/pablo-meier/">my profile</a> here,
and <a href="https://github.com/pablo-meier?tab=repositories">much of my open programming work</a>.</p>
<h5><strong>IMDb</strong> and <strong>LinkedIn</strong></h5>
<p>I'm listing these here only because they're the most obvious parallels, which
people seem to 'get' immediately when I try to describe ghostlight. For the
record, I hate the comparison since I see a few differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>IMDb, for most of its visitors, is where we go to gawk at <em>other people's</em>
work, not <em>our own</em>. If you're in film or television you may have a page
and/or use it very differently, but I feel the site is very geared to
consumers rather than creators. Obviously I don't want to
discourage people from using ghostlight as consumers; just that its
development is driven by the needs of professionals.</li>
<li>IMDb is ugly as sin.</li>
<li>I've literally never used or had a LinkedIn profile in my life, so it really
can't inform how I build this or what I want to do with it.</li>
<li>Part of the reason I never got an account was the LinkedIn was one of the
pioneers of that spammy 'Invite Everyone In Your Address Book' bullshit. My
hope is that ghostlight never does anything like that.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>But</em>, like LinkedIn, I totes believe you can use this to get a better handle on
your networks (if that is what you do on LinkedIn, idk).</p>
<h3>What are the economics of ghostlight? Who's paying for it? Is ghostlight for sale?</h3>
<p>I'm currently paying for this out-of-pocket. Programming is good work and I'm
working for a great company, so they compensate me well enough that I can
self-run this, at least for now. If this grows and The Powers That Be want to
charge me more than I can comfortably afford for this, I might not be able to
keep it running, but lets cross that bridge when we get to it.</p>
<h3>Is ghostlight for sale?</h3>
<p>God, I hope not. I have no intention to sell it. I'm not even a Company.</p>
<h3>Can I help work on ghostlight?</h3>
<p>I'm glad you asked! I happen to think programming and software are pretty
awful ecosystems, with heavy gatekeeping preventing enthusiastic, capable
newbies from participating, especially if they are people of underrepresented
groups. Good thing theatre's not like that!!!!</p>
<p>One idea I often hear brought up as a potential solution to these issues is the
notion of apprenticeships, and placing a greater emphasis on mentoring. I would
be delighted to teach software to a motivated person (or group of people), and
we could use ghostlight as a place where they can flex their chops.</p>
<p>So <strong>if you have an interest in learning to code and would like me to teach you,
please contact me. _No previous experience required._</strong> Note that I'll be giving
preference to people of underrepresented groups: women, racial/ethic minorities,
queer. If that bothers you significantly I'd guess we're likely to have a hard
working relationship in an environment where I make decisions, so you dodged a
bullet!</p>
<p>(actually tho if that answer bothers you feel free to contact me and we can hash
it out).</p>
<h3>I hate this project.</h3>
<p>Sorry, homes.</p>
<h3>No really! This is going to <em>kill</em> theatre!</h3>
<p>Theatre is killing theatre. The Internet, generally, is killing Theatre. Radio
killed Theatre. TV killed Theatre. Literally everything is killing theatre. Can
you kill something that's been actively getting killed by literally everything
for the last century? Might it already be dead?</p>
<p>I think most pearl-clutching is easily responded to with</p>
<ul>
<li>This, or something like it, is inevitable.</li>
<li>This is only a drop in the bucket.</li>
<li>Theatre, as both an art-making institution and economically sustainable
institution, has bigger problems than someone caring enough about it to try
making a database for it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>One of my favorite things about Theatre is that it's ephemeral. After strike, the material disappears but magic remains, and the world is a little better. Our lives are a little more enriched. No detritus, no residue, but <strong>impact</strong> regardless; just people making things for people. <em>So much</em> of our lives are quantified and commoditized around data, gameable metrics, and marketeable artifacts, and I love that this is an area where that isn't centered. By doing this, you'll create a theatre culture around people comparing their 'ghostlight profiles,' have yet another system to game, and otherwise reduce making Theatre as Yet Another Product I Succumb To, And Have To Win. That's horseshit.</h3>
<p>That's... all true. I'm sensitive to this line of argument (after all, I just
wrote it). I guess all I can say to that is</p>
<ul>
<li>I still feel like the bullets above apply, unfortunately. But imagine me
saying them more sensitively! Because I agree, much of modern life and the
things we build around it is horseshit.</li>
<li>I'll do the best I can to make the most responsible software I can, given all
of this.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do hope any and all of you with concerns on this bring them up on the
<a href="https://discourse.ghostlight.io">Discourse site</a> I set up, <em>precisely so</em> we can discuss what ghostlight is,
be mindful of its impacts, and where to subsequently take it.</p>
