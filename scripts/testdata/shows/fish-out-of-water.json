With many of the tapes made during her engagement she tries to navigate the fine line between want and need, funny and awkward, new beginnings or happy endings. An exploration in documentation, sex, need, and lusty cupcake eating, KRAPP'S LAST SEX TAPE draws from found and created footage to discern what we are all searching for."

It is about those words, those people, those situations that linger inside long after their moments have passed. It is about looking for pleasure and finding pain. It is about Charly learning to put words to her desire and, in turn, learning to define herself."
