# I would love your help!

## Hi! I love you!

Hi friends! It's me, Pablo (or Paul). I'm sending you a **fancy** email because
I'm going to ask you a **fancy** favor!

_Can you give me honest feedback on something I'm working on?_

I'm emailing you first because, of my many acquaintances who've made their lives
in the Arts, you're someone I trust, and whose opinions I value, in both a
professional and a personal context.

I've been thinking about this on-and-off for a few years now, and working on
pretty hard on nights and weekends for the past month or two, on top of my
full-time job. While I would love to keep going with it stubbornly knowing I Am
Right And It Is Perfect, the fact is I don't work full-time in the arts and am
only one person -- I can't really know what large numbers of artists like or
need. I also need some feedback to break out of any tunnelvision before it gets
super solidified.

## SO what are you working on?

There's a few ways of saying it, so I'll give you a few of them. It's called
**Ghostlight**, and the one-liner that I don't love is

**IMDb for theatre and live performance.**

Another is

**[GitHub](https://github.com) for Dancers and Theatre Artists**

What the app actually _is_:

* You take the information in a program you'd get at a show: what the piece was,
  who produced the show, who acted in it, who did the designs, and you add it to
  the app.
* Every person, organization, and piece is linked with every time they've been 
  entered. This means, when you're looking at a show's page, you can click any
  actor (or Lighting Designer, or the producing organization, or the author of
  the work, or the work itself...) and get taken to _their_ page, which lists
  all the other work they're connected with.  Which you can click, which takes
  you to another page...
* If you're the person in question, you can naturally manage parts of your
  page to include photos, a Bio, links to your social media, etc.

So this is a bit like IMDb: you click the page for [Fast &
Furious](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1013752/), and you can see photos, press,
cast, &c. From there, I can click [Vin Diesel's
page](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004874/) and learn everything he's ever done.

If you are one of my Brown buddies, there is a _very small chance_ this looks
familiar to you. That's because this was a system that happened slightly ad-hoc
using the [PW wiki!](http://pw.brown.edu/wiki/start). During my time there, I
uploaded the information in some of the show programs to wiki pages ([here's one I
did](http://pw.brown.edu/wiki/shows/accidental_death_of_an_anarchist), and
[another](http://pw.brown.edu/wiki/shows/a_doll_house)) that got listed in the
[past shows](http://pw.brown.edu/wiki/shows/index) page). If I could, I'd link
anybody to a person page they made for themselves ([here's
one](http://pw.brown.edu/wiki/people/alex_lubensky_09),
[another](http://pw.brown.edu/wiki/people/kathryn_wallem_07),
[mine](http://pw.brown.edu/wiki/people/paul_meier_09)). They could also list
themselves for work on [The Green
Book](http://pw.brown.edu/wiki/people/greenbook).

Using just a Wiki and basic links, you can build a pretty rich system, but
I wanted to make something bigger. I have a stack of programs of the 20+ shows
Charly and I have seen since we moved here in August and I would love build
something that shows exactly how rich and meaningful the work of the people
listed on them was.

## That's what Ghostlight _is_, but what problems is it solving?

Part of this was also due to my own frustrations from when I was more 'in the
game'. Here are the Big 3:

### Archiving

Most of us are so focused on _creating the work_ we don't do a particularly
great job of archiving it. It's much, much easier these days now that The Cloud
is a thing and we've got Dropbox, Evernote, and other providers, but back in
2007ish when we were in college it was hard as hell. I don't have almost
anything left from my Music degree, and most of what I have on my college work
is pretty woeful.

Ghostlight hopefully makes that easier. You can just have a page you can link to
with some confidence that has all the relevant information of any show,
organization, or piece that you've built and been a part of. It's not too much
work to add the requisite information and then, _it's up there._

### Web Presence

I looked at a lot of my friend's websites, and they mostly have similar things
on them. Here's a smattering:

* [CAPS LOCK THEATRE](http://capslocktheatre.com/)
* [Liz Morgan](http://www.lizmorganonline.com/)
* [Dan Rogers](http://www.danrogersdirects.com/)
* [plumage.](http://plumagewrites.tumblr.com/)
* [Allyson Currin](http://www.allysoncurrin.com)
* [Daria Miyeko Marinelli](http://www.dariamiyekomarinelli.com/)
* [Theater Reconstruction Ensemble](http://www.reconstructionensemble.org/)

Not **at all** a knock on these websites: they're beautiful, and clearly a lot
of work went into them. With that in mind: most of them have about the same
things, and have to be kept up-to-date by the person/organization who'd probably
rather be doing something else. With something like Ghostlight, a) that would be
handled automatically, b) _all_ the referenced work, people, and organizations
would be linked to more descriptive pages, and c) there's a centralized place to
look for more information on anyone/anything in theatre ("let's check out their
Ghostlight page").

### Networking!

Lastly -- networking! If you have a searchable, up-to-date database of _everyone
you've worked with_ and _everyone they've ever worked with_, well, I think
that'd be pretty cool. Not just for the person using the product, but for me
and what I could build on it, too.

Here's a funny story: I went to the wedding of the most marvelous person in my
high school with my girlfriend Charly, where we ran into -- [Andrew
Neisler](http://freshgroundpeppernyc.com/andrew-neisler/)! Who interviewed
Charly for [Fresh Ground Pepper's _brb_ retreat](http://freshgroundpeppernyc.com/brb/)!
After a few "lol so crazy"s, Andrew chuckled and said something to the effect of
"heh, and we were trying to branch out by getting a Philly artist."

These networks are there, and how cool if we had a database we could both see
the links we wouldn't otherwise, or avoid them! I was thinking it'd be fun to
organize a Ghostlight retreat like _brb_, but find "islands" from the data (the
"NYU alum mafia" island, the "Brown alum proletariat" island...) get a few groups
together from people of different islands expressly for the purposes of
cross-pollination.

(Charly and I saw something like that happen in a lovely way -- we saw [Stevo
Arnoczy](http://www.harunalee.com/stevo.html) and [Trevor Salter](http://www.uniqueboard.com/trevorfsalter)
perform a collaboration called _mothertongue_ at the [FGP Birthday
Party](https://www.facebook.com/events/1691968014363395/) after meeting for the
first time, and getting along swimmingly, at Charly's _brb_).

((bee tee dubs the links in that last paragraph all required separate Google
searches, and would have been easier... _**with Ghostlight!!!!**_
<small><em>vaudeville hook...</em></small>))

## What can I do?

Use it! Add a program or two if you have one I missed, edit your page, and let
me know things like

* Is this something you'd even do?
* What's good about it? What sucks about it?

**Please remember this is, like, 40% done.** I'm showing it off to a few of you
early in the spirit of ["30%
feedback"](https://42floors.com/blog/startups/thirty-percent-feedback) -- it's
probably too early to _really_ show, but this also allows you to give me the
most valuable, impactful feedback. That means _spare no courtesy_ and please be
brutal, and feel free to comment on broad issues with it too, not just "it's
ugly" (oy, it is ugly).

## How can I give you feedback?

I'm glad you asked! I'm launching it to you with two other baby sites:

* I'm launching a [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) instance at
  [discuss.ghostlight.io](discuss.ghostlight.io). I think it's pretty brilliant
  that [all StackExchange sites have a Meta
  site](http://meta.stackexchange.com/tour), a place where they can discuss the
  community as they build it. I have no idea how Ghostlight will turn out, but I
  want it to be a place we got to because we discussed it.
* I'm also launching a blog at [blog.ghostlight.io](blog.ghostlight.io). Many of
  the posts will be technical, but my hope is not all of them are, and that
  should shed some light as to where I'm coming from.
* I'm also tracking what I have left to do (and bugs I encouter) with a 
  [Trello](https://trello.com) board. It's private, but if you guys tell me your
  Trello usernames, I'll gladly give you access so you can see how I'm doing.

You can also email me at [pablo@ghostlight.io](mailto:pablo@ghoslight.io), or
call or text me at (240) 535-3882.

## Has this been tried before?

Yes and no. My heart sank the first time Charly told me about
[Stage32](https://www.stage32.com/welcome/). I was like _"someone did this
already I'm a failure!"_. But then I logged in, saw it was a spamfest of
LinkedIn-looking horseshit, didn't see anything it offered me, and realized that
just because someone executed on an idea, doesn't mean they did it well.

There are related problems that are getting some tech treatment.
[NewPlayExchange](https://newplayexchange.org/) got some fanfare when it
launched, and you can see that they also have a 'person' page
([Charly!](https://newplayexchange.org/users/975/charly-simpson)) and a 'piece'
page ([_or what she
will_](https://newplayexchange.org/plays/20713/or-what-she-will)) which link up
like Ghostlight does. But again, the whole thing feels corporate, and requires
you to pay to search it effectively. There was a lot of talk that it would
"change the game" but I haven't seen it yet. And Ghostlight is more about
productions, people, and organizations: the works of art themselves just come
as a byproduct.

Another notable app is [NewPlayMap](http://newplaymap.org/). Some days its a
ghost town, others it's got a fair bit of activity. The poor thing hasn't
received much love for [the last 4
years](https://github.com/newplaymap/newplaymap). Radically different than what
I'm doing.

If you know of others, let me know! I was going to tweet a photo at
NewPlayExchange wearing aviators and smoking from a vape pen, with "I'M COMING
FOR YOU, NEWPLAYX" but figured that might be in poor taste. In my mind it's
friendly competition, but I'd also like to work together with whoever's out
there: one of the links a person, organization, or play can add, aside from the
usual Tumblr/Facebook/Twitter types is their NewPlayExchange link.
