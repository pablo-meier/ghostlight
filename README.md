# Ghostlight

ðŸ‘»

Ghostlight is a web application written in Erlang meant to be the 'IMDb for live
performance': it would be a searchable, linked catalogue of all the information
in a show's program. My primary use case was for theater and musicals, but
there's no reason it couldn't be used for concerts, magic shows, opera, modern
danceâ€¦

It's incomplete, the engineering unpolished, and butt-ugly, but it was a
learning experience as much as anything else, and done entirely by me in spare
time when I _wasn't_ going to the 60-80ish shows I went to that year.

I might resurrect it, but in case I don't, it's here for the world to see/pick
apart.

See the [blog](http://blog.ghostlight.io), or visit the [running
instance](https://ghostlight.io), bugs and all.

## Build

I tried using [rebar3](https://www.rebar3.org/) for everything (rather than the
rebar-but-also-a-Makefile of times previous), so you should _ostensibly_ be able
to just invoke

    $ rebar3 compile

But `merl` you to jump into the `_build` director and run `make` in it, because
the Erlang ecosystem is great.

Note also that `erlydtl` can also trip you up by requires you to have about a
gig of memory to run its compile step. I learned this when I hit an
out-of-memory error building this on a tiny Joyent instance.

To run, you can `rebar3 shell`, or just do what I did and build a full release
with

    $ rebar3 release

then running `./_build/default/rel/ghostlight/bin/ghostlight console`. It's
nasty.

Config is done in `config/sys.config`. It's not checked in, but copy
`sys.config.sample` and fill in the blanks.

## Stacks, architecture

This is structured as an Erlang "umbrella" project, so you can build all the
components from the toplevel, and each directory under `apps/` is it's own OTP
application. The apps more or less map to packages in other languages.

That said, because the Erlang VM maps everything to a global namespace, it's
irresponsible to _not_ prefix your app's name to every module, which is why
every Module takes the form `<app_name>_file.erl`. It makes filenames (and
fully-qualified function calls) very long ðŸ˜©

Here are the apps and a description of them:

### `ghostlight`

This is, naturally, the top-level app, which has the other apps as dependencies.
This _mostly_ sets up the Cowboy server, sets up routing, and handles other
shared logic around request handling REST.

Note that in name of separating concerns, it communicates to other apps solely
with the records defined in `apps/ghostlight/include/ghostlight_data.hrl`. It's
responsible for parsing JSON representations of the resources and rendering
their HTML templates, but those details are obscured away from the other apps,
as are the details of the other apps (i.e. persistent backend choice and data
format) from it.

### `ghostlight_db`

This app handles persistent data, using (as mentioned elsewhere) Postgres. It
handles saving, updating, and retrieving the data.

### `ghostlight_config`

One of my Trello items is to remove this from being its own app: it could
probably just be a module in top-level ghostlight. This serves as a way to get
config information we don't check in (i.e. through the `sys.config` file and/or
environment variables).

### `ghostlight_markdown`

Handles parsing Markdown. See below, in "Jinterface, C Ports" to see why this is
both the best and worst app in this project.

### `ghostlight_fulltext`

Also arguably should be a single module, this is the interface for making a
full-text search of the data for user search queries.

### `ghostlight_auth`

Preliminary, unshipped code for Twitter auth, could be expanded for other
providers like Google or FB.

### `ghostlight_devtools`

The Ghostiest app in Ghostlight, this was tearfully abandoned like Daniel
Day-Lewis' son in _There Will Be Blood_. The intention of this app was to be a
module that watches the source directory and reloads modules, as well as adding
a "productionizing" step to the ErlyDtl templates and frontend code. I got most
of the way there, but left it to die when I figured I'd rather work on features
and sank a few weeks into it already.

## Dependencies, making a mess

If it isn't clear, I didn't invest a whole lot in the build system or ops of
this. Here some irregularities/WTFs:

### Backends

Ghostlight uses Postgres for the Source Of Truth and most real data, because
it's just the best database. Fight me. Migrations that describe the data model
are in `scripts/sql`. One of the more fun, and I'd argue, successful, parts of
this project was modelling shows and their components relationally.

I didn't put any real work into carefully adding indices or anything, so there
are easy wins there.

This uses ElasticSearch as something of searchable cache: this lets us do
full-text search on user queries without bending Postgres, as well as a fairly 
straightforward way to do dynamic queries. There are no config parameters for ES
because I was running it locally; it obviously wouldn't be too hard to remedy
this.

### Jinterface, C ports

Part of the fun of this was learning about the [Jinterface][1] and [Ports][2].
Part of the hell in developing and maintaining this was using the Jinterface
and Ports. Here's the short summary:

* Both `ghostlight_markdown` and `ghostlight_devtools` use the Jinterface for
  specific functionality, and `ghostlight_markdown` has a C port.

* This means for the app to function properly, you need to ensure that the C and
  Java sources are compiled. C uses the [CommonMark][3] C implementation shared
  library, Java uses a few JARs that should be checked in.

* After the app starts up, you need to ensure the connection of the Jinterface
  nodes. This is a bear and a half: refer to [Learn You Some Erlang][4] for
  instructions on how to set up a cluster of the several nodes.

* If you want to make sure everything that needs to be connected is, run
  `ghostlight_healthchecks:run()` in a connected erlang shell.

* I can't guarantee some of the names of nodes aren't defined in sources. Grep
  around.

If I'm a little jaded here, it's because I am! But this was a genuinely
rewarding part of the project.

##### Sidebar: rationale for this shit, because who chooses this?

My favorite web apps that include any level of sophisticated text use
[Markdown][5], but [Markdown implementations are notoriously inconsistent][6],
and Erlang doesn't have many implementations. The main one appears to be this
[erlware][7] one, which, guess what!? Is [home-rolled!][8] So you get the
efficiencies of Erlang with the unpredictability of Markdown!

So I went with [CommonMark][9], our Best Last Hope at some standardization of
Markdown, and their C implementation, since if I was going to call a port, why
not the fastest one? That's the reason for the C port.

As for Jinterface: once we allow users to submit content that we will display
back, we become vulnerable to [XSS][10], and as in Markdown, I don't want to
write the sanitization code myself (mostly a function of laziness, but also
because I'm bound to get it wrong and expose a security vulnerability). So I
relied on the [OWASP Sanitizer][11] to scrub user input, which relies on a way
to "speak Java."

`ghostlight_devtools` is usually never connected because it's an app that I
never really finished, but the libraries it's talking to are the [Google Closure
Compiler][12] and the [YUI Compressor][13] for JS and CSS
concatenation/minification, respectively.

### There will/should be a whole lot moreâ€¦

â€¦as there were a million terrible design decisions, compromises, lessons
learned, and Delightful Hacks, but those probably belong in blog posts or on the
wiki, which I'll Totally Writeâ„¢. Still, this was a few months of passionate
work, so let this be a first step in Sharing.
