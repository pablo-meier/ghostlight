  "description": "Her name is Kapow-i GoGo. And she's going to save The World. Again. And again. And again. Matt Cox's Kapow-i GoGo is an epic, three-part, live-action mash up of Dragon Ball Z, graphic novels, space operas, the Final Fantasy series, and every after-school cartoon you watched in the mid-to-late '90s. It's a geek's Coast of Utopia. A nerd Gatz.\n\n...with cooler hair.\n\n...and more robotic appendages.\n\n_Kapow-i GoGo_ is a theatrical experience built for an audience used to binge-watching Netflix.\n\nIt began as one of the most popular plays at The Flea Theater's #serials@theflea. For the PIT run, the show has been expanded and re-conceived into three totally new, separate evenings: Kapow-i GoGo Gooooo!, Kapow-i GoGo Z, and Kapow-i Returns, taking our plucky blue-haired fighter from ages 14 to 30, following her journey to collect all the legendary Hydra Crystals, to the World's Martial Arts Tournament, to far-flung future dystopias and fights with power-mad cybernetic generals, giant robots, mountain monsters and assorted other final bosses. And, of course, saving the princess.",
